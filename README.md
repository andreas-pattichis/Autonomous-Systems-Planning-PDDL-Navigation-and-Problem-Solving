# Classical Planning Lab Repository

This repository showcases my solutions for Lab Project 2 of the Autonomous Systems course, which focuses on classical planning. It includes PDDL models for a series of navigation and problem-solving exercises designed to deepen the understanding of planning in AI.

## Project Overview

Lab Project 2 is structured around three main sections, each requiring the development and execution of PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) models to navigate through a series of complex problems.

### 1. Navigation Problems

Here, the tasks involve moving an agent from an initial to a goal location within a grid world, navigating around obstacles, and creating a plan in the form of an action sequence.

### 2. Keys and Doors

This section extends the navigation problems with the addition of keys and doors, adding complexity to the agent's environment. The agent is required to pick up keys and unlock doors to reach the goal location.

### 3. Generalized Planning

The final part involves completing the PDDL domain definition for a generalized planner and executing it to produce plans that solve all instances in a given set.

## Learning Outcomes

- Mastered classical planning problem modeling in PDDL.
- Developed a proficiency in automating plan generation using classical planners.
- Applied problem-solving strategies for navigation and key-door puzzles.
- Gained insights into generalized planning techniques.

## Additional Information

Each section of the lab is documented with specific problem configurations, my PDDL models, and the generated solutions. For detailed explanations of the problem sets and methodologies used, please refer to the individual sections in the repository.
